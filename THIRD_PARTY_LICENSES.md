# Third Party Licenses

MixedBerryPie uses several third-party libraries and assets. This document lists their licenses and attributions.

## Important: Combined Work Licensing

While the original source code of MixedBerryPie is licensed under the **MIT License**, the distributed application (such as the `.exe` installer) is a "combined work" that includes **PyQt6**.

Since PyQt6 is licensed under the **GNU GPL v3**, the **distributed application as a whole is subject to the terms of the GNU GPL v3**. This ensures compliance with the copyleft requirements of the Qt framework.
