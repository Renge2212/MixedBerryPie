# Security Policy

## Privacy & Data Protection

MixedBerryPie prioritize user privacy and security above all else. 

- **No Data Collection**: MixedBerryPie does NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, shortcut configurations, or keyboard inputs to any external servers.
- **No Network Communication**: The application does not require an internet connection to function and does not make any network calls (except for what you explicitly configure, such as "Open URL" actions). 
- **Keyboard Hook Security**: While the app uses global keyboard hooks to detect your shortcuts, this data is processed entirely on your local machine and is never logged or saved.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it by opening a [GitHub Issue](../../issues) or contacting the maintainer directly.
